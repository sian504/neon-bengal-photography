# Neon Bengal Photography

![Website on different screens](Insert Am I Responsive )

Neon Bengal Photography is a fullstack ecommerce application for an imaginary freelance photographer. This project was inspired by my first project for this certificate, Camera_and_Curls, and uses my own photography portfolio to create a shop where users are able to purchases prints. This project uses Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python and all data is stored in a PostgreSQL database via ElephantSQL
